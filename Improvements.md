Your code is looking quite solid for hosting a static website! Here's a brief review and some suggestions for improvement.

### Overall Summary:

1. **Main Server Setup**: You're using `Fiber`, which is great for Go-based web applications, and your routing setup is clear and structured.
2. **Static Hosting**: You're serving static files using the `app.Static()` method for your static folder, which is appropriate for hosting static assets.
3. **S3 Integration**: The S3 uploading logic is well-organized, and you've set up AWS SDK correctly to upload files to an S3 bucket. You're handling the upload of both HTML and other static assets, which is essential for a static website.
4. **Directory Structure Detection**: You've implemented a way to detect whether a project is static or dynamic based on the presence of `index.html` or `package.json`, which is efficient for differentiating project types.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Error Handling in File Uploads**: Your `UploadStaticSite` function has a great approach to walking through the file system and uploading files. However, if any file upload fails, the function will stop. It would be a good idea to add some retry logic or handle errors more gracefully to ensure a full upload if possible.

   **Example**:

   ```go
   if err != nil {
       log.Printf("Failed to upload file %s: %v", key, err)
       continue // Log the error and continue uploading other files
   }
   ```

2. **Missing .env Validation for S3 Bucket**: You're already validating environment variables for MongoDB, but it might be a good idea to handle an absence of the `S3_BUCKET_NAME` more explicitly. Right now, if it's missing, the app will log and exit. Instead, adding a check at the start of the program could give you a clearer feedback mechanism.

   ```go
   if s3Bucket == "" {
       log.Fatal("S3_BUCKET_NAME is not set in .env file")
   }
   ```

3. **Security Considerations**:

   * **CORS Configuration**: While you've used the `cors` middleware, ensure that it's set up correctly to allow the proper origins to access your static assets. If the website will be accessed from various domains, you might want to customize the CORS policy.

     Example:

     ```go
     app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
         AllowOrigins: "http://localhost:3000, https://yourdomain.com", // Customize as needed
         AllowMethods: "GET,POST",
     }))
     ```

   * **Permissions for S3**: Ensure that the S3 bucket permissions allow for public access to static files if you're using it for hosting websites. For enhanced security, ensure that only certain paths or files are publicly accessible, and other paths remain private.

4. **Static Directory Access**:

   * You're using `app.Static()` to serve static files from a directory. This is perfect, but ensure the static folder structure is correct when uploading to S3.
   * You've implemented the URL redirection for paths like `/autoship-server/static/:username/:repo/*`, which is a clever way to redirect users. Ensure that these paths correctly match the S3 structure after deployment.

5. **GitHub Callback URL**: Your route for GitHub callback (`app.Get("/github/callback", api.GitHubCallback)`) might be commented out (`// app.Get("/auth/github/callback", api.GitHubCallback)`). Be sure you’re using the correct callback URL format that matches your GitHub OAuth setup.

6. **Custom URL Generation for Static Sites**: The logic for generating a URL to the `index.html` file (`indexURL := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/index.html", s3WebsiteURL, keyPrefix)`) is spot-on. It ensures that users can access the hosted site directly. However, consider adding more comprehensive error handling in case the upload fails or S3 returns a non-200 response.

### Minor Enhancements:

1. **Health Route**: You have a health check route (`/health`)—it’s a great practice to include these for monitoring purposes. Consider adding additional health checks (like database or S3) for better observability.
2. **Environment Variable Loading**: Ensure that your `.env` file contains all necessary environment variables for your application, including S3 settings, JWT, MongoDB, and any other services you may be using.

### Conclusion:

The code is well-written and achieves the goal of hosting static websites with Go, Fiber, and S3. With a few improvements related to error handling, security, and environment variable validation, you’ll have a solid and reliable system.
