### üöÄ Project Plan: Build a Mini Hosting Platform

This plan outlines the steps required to create a hosting platform similar to Vercel or Netlify. Each step is broken down into actionable tasks.

---

### üß† **Basic Workflow Tasks:**

1. **User Input**:
    - [ ] Create a form for users to submit their GitHub repository URL.
    - [ ] Validate the submitted URL to ensure it points to a valid GitHub repository.

2. **Clone Repository**:
    - [ ] Set up the backend to handle repository cloning using Go.
        - [ ] Create a REST API endpoint in Go to accept GitHub repository URLs.
        - [ ] Use the `os/exec` package or a Go Git library (e.g., `go-git`) to clone the repository.
        - [ ] Store the cloned repository in a temporary directory with a unique identifier.

    3. **Build & Host**:
        - [ ] Implement logic in Go to detect the project type (e.g., HTML, Node.js, React).
        - [ ] Use the `os/exec` package to run commands for installing dependencies (e.g., `npm install` or `yarn install`).
        - [ ] Build the project if required (e.g., `npm run build` for React).
        - [ ] Serve the project using a static file server (e.g., `http.FileServer`) or a runtime environment.

    4. **Assign URL**:
        - [ ] Configure the backend to assign a unique URL for each project.
        - [ ] Use a subdomain format like `username.yourdomain.com` or a dynamic route like `yourdomain.com/project/12345`.
        - [ ] Update reverse proxy settings (e.g., NGINX) to map the URL to the hosted project.

    5. **Show Live Link**:
        - [ ] Create an API endpoint in Go to return the generated live link.
        - [ ] Update the Next.js frontend to display the live link to the user.
        - [ ] Provide options to copy or share the link.

    ### üîß **Tech Stack Tasks**:

    1. **Frontend**:
        - [ ] Build a user interface using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
        - [ ] Include features for submitting URLs, showing progress, and displaying the live link.
        - [ ] Add login and signup options for users using email or GitHub authentication.
        - [ ] Provide users with options to host either a static website or a web service.

    2. **Backend**:
        - [ ] Set up a backend using Go with a framework like `Gin` or `Echo`.
        - [ ] Implement endpoints for handling repository cloning, building, and serving.

    3. **Cloning Repositories**:
        - [ ] Integrate `go-git` or use system commands to clone repositories.
        - [ ] Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid URLs or private repositories.

    4. **Deployment**:
        - [ ] Use Docker containers to isolate builds and deployments.
        - [ ] Configure NGINX to serve static content or runtime environments.

    5. **URL Management**:
        - [ ] Use NGINX or a reverse proxy to map custom URLs to hosted projects.
        - [ ] Maintain a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to track and resolve paths for dynamic routes.

    6. **Domain & Subdomain**:
        - [ ] Purchase a domain and configure wildcard DNS (e.g., `*.yourdomain.com`).
        - [ ] Use tools like `nginx-proxy` for advanced routing.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security and Maintenance Tasks**:

1. **Security**:
    - [ ] Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    - [ ] Isolate builds using Docker or similar technologies.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
    - [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the system.
    - [ ] Monitor GitHub API usage to avoid hitting rate limits.

3. **Cleanup**:
    - [ ] Set up a process to automatically remove old repositories and builds after a specified time.

4. **Build Logs**:
    - [ ] Capture and display real-time build logs for user transparency.
    - [ ] Store logs temporarily for debugging purposes.

### üß™ **MVP Goals**:

1. [ ] Allow users to input a GitHub repository URL.
2. [ ] Clone the repository and build the project.
3. [ ] Serve the project and provide a live link.
