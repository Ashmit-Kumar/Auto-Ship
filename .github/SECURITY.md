# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security issues in Auto-Ship.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers privately at: security@autoship.example (replace with the project owner's real address).

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact.
- Steps to reproduce, including minimal proof-of-concept if possible.
- Affected versions or commit hash.
- Any logs, stack traces or screenshots that help reproduce the problem.

Response timeline
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- We aim to provide an initial assessment and mitigation plan within 7 days.
- For critical vulnerabilities we will prioritize fixes and coordinate disclosure.

## Disclosure
- Please give maintainers a reasonable time to fix the issue before publicly disclosing details (typically 60â€“90 days depending on severity).
- We will coordinate public disclosure and credit the reporter unless they request anonymity.

## Supported Versions
- Security fixes are provided for the current `main` branch and the latest released tag. If you are unsure whether a release is supported, contact the security email.

## Safe Practices
- Avoid sending sensitive secrets when reporting issues. If secrets are required to reproduce, share them via secure channels or use redacted examples and instructions to recreate the scenario.

## PGP (Optional)
- If you prefer to encrypt your report, please request our public PGP key via the security email.

Thank you for helping keep Auto-Ship safe.
