# üöÄ Auto-Ship
This project aims to build a hosting platform similar to Vercel or Netlify. It allows users to deploy their GitHub repositories and host them with a unique live link.

---

## üß† **Basic Workflow**

### 1. User Input
- Users submit their GitHub repository URL through a form.
- The system validates the URL to ensure it points to a valid GitHub repository.

### 2. Clone Repository
- The backend clones the repository using Go.
- Cloned repositories are stored in temporary directories with unique identifiers.

### 3. Build & Host
- The system detects the project type (e.g., HTML, Node.js, React).
- It installs dependencies, builds the project if required, and serves it using a static file server or runtime environment.

### 4. Assign URL
- Each project is assigned a unique URL (e.g., `username.yourdomain.com` or `yourdomain.com/project/12345`).
- Reverse proxy settings are updated to map the URL to the hosted project.

### 5. Show Live Link
- Users receive a live link to their hosted project, which they can copy or share.
